<p>I've started this site so that I can document and express some of my feelings over the past few years. Why didn't I create this earlier, I don't know why. Maybe it's because I've discovered git-hub.</p>

  When I was seven, I wanted to be a Car Mechanic at a gasoline station.<br>
  When I was in college, I wanted to be a Structural Engineer designing bridges and buildings.<br>
  Right out of college, I was a Construction Engineer for a now bankrupt construction company.<br>
        I didn't even list it on my work history as I only worked there for three months.<br>
  When I interviewed at Boeing, I only talked to the hiring manager and was hired a week later.<br>
  The Asian Economic Crisis hit and I was laid off. I studied for and passed the MCSE certification.<br>
  The tech bubble was blowing up and I landed at Exodus, a high flyer that went 3-1, 2-1 stock splits then to bankruptcy all in four years. At the two year mark, I was one of many paper millionaires.<br>
        I wish I had cashed some out.<br>
  During my time at Exodus, I passed the CCNA and CCNP.  However, all of my certifications from the bubble era have expired which is why I do not list them here.<br><br>
  As the bubble burst and facing another lay off, I was pulled by a former manager into the Data Backup Team. Essentially, this was the Level II customer support escalation team for data backups. This was the highest level though as we would escalate to our backup software vendor. I spoke to customers daily and never feared jumping on a conference call to troubleshoot the issues.<br>
